# 🌍 STEI – How about staying with us

**STEI**  is a decentralized, tenant-to-tenant rental platform built on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) blockchain. It connects **moving-in tenants** with **moving-out tenants** in Tanzania, helping them bypass exploitative real estate agencies and enabling secure, low-cost rental agreements using smart contracts and USDC escrow.

> 💡 "Why pay 300,000 TZS in commission to a broker for a 300,000 TZS apartment? STEI connects tenants directly—fairly, transparently, and affordably."

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🏠 **Tenant-to-Tenant Listings**  
  Moving-out tenants list available units, saving time and reducing vacancy losses.

- 🤝 **Smart Contract Agreements**  
  Powered by [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org), our contracts ensure that rental agreements are digitally signed and legally anchored.

- 💸 **USDC Escrow Payments**  
  Funds are held in escrow until terms are verified, reducing fraud and increasing trust.

- 📜 **Traditional Contract Support**  
  For legal enforceability under Tanzanian law, users can download a PDF agreement.

- 📲 **Mobile-First Design (Coming Soon)**  
  Optimized for Android-first users to reach underserved populations.
